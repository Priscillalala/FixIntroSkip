# Fix Intro Skip

The Seekers of the Storm update made the splash screen and intro cutscene play during loading instead of after. It seems like that broke the `intro_skip` and `splash_skip` config options so this mod fixes them.

This mod won't skip the intro by itself, you need to enable `intro_skip` and `splash_skip` in the game's config file or through commands.
